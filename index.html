<p>Blue Mountains Bike Race</p>
<p>August 13, 2022</p>
<p>La Grande, Oregon</p>
<hr>
<p>BMBR is a self supported bicycle race in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. It is roughly 122 miles with 12,500ft of climbing. Most of the route is on dirt roads, with one section of singletrack, and some pavement connecting it all together. A rough draft of the course can be found here: <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/38622602">https://ridewithgps.com/routes/38622602</a></p>
<p>There is no entry fee for this race. If you are able, I do ask that you <a href="https://bluemountainstc.org/donate">make a donation to the Blue Mountain Singetrack Trails Club</a>, which will be put towards building a pump track here in La Grande.</p>
<p>Registration coming soon.</p>
